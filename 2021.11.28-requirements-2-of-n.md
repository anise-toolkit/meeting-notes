## Action items of previous meeting

+ [x] *Everyone:*
    + [x] Populate the requirements list as per the process defined below. File is
         on Google Spreadsheets, [here][requirement list url].
    + [x] Populate the slides for the LSIC meeting. Keep it short, only 10 minutes
         and plus 5 of Q&A. File is on Google Slides, [here][presentation LSIC url].
+ [ ] Greg:
    + [ ] Start working on the Rust project with the `specs` repo as a submodule
    + [ ] Investigate whether Flatbuffers could be used to write tests, or if another

          join too

## Discussion

1. We've passed the mid-November deadline. However, in this long meeting (2.5
   hours) we discussed in detail the requirements.
1. Greg recalled that flatbuffer is for I/O, codebase will be in Rust for other
   language that will be wrapped around to benefit Rust's safety.

### Programming language support

1. It's clear that FORTRAN is still thoroughly used in the aerospace industry.
   Jacob Williams (lead software engineer extraordinaire of Copernicus) announced
   that he would be [interested][interest ANISE url] in ANISE if a FORTRAN
   interface was provided. **Let's make it happen!**
1. Greg says that FORTRAN can call C code. Therefore, the first idea here is to
   use the Rust code to build the FORTRAN interface (we'll probably need to use
   `no_mangle`).

### File structure, unique object identifiers

1. An original requirement was to store the ephemeris and the orientations as
   trees. Although that would work, this tree structure adds lots of complexity
   in storing the unique ID of a body and orientation root in a way that is
   copiable. We discussed storing this as similar to IP addresses with different
   bits corresponding to different levels of the tree. We also discussed the
   extensability of this method, whether it would allow storing Hipparcos ESA
   star catalog, and what other issues we'd likely encounter.
1. Moreover, a tree architecture is excellent for an `O(k)` access to the children
   of a given object (where `k` is the depth). **However**, in reference frame
   transformations, we can't typicalling looking for the children of a given object
   but for the parents. With the tree organization, this means we need to compare
   the starting blocks of the unique identifier of the object. This works, but we
   still have `O(k)` translations and `O(k')` rotations for `k` depth of translation
   and `k'` depth of rotation. Again, this works, but it probably isn't optimal.
1. In addition to being copiable (i.e. made of primitives that the compiler can place
   on the stack), we want to allow users to store their own data in the kernels
   without overwriting some standard names. One way to handle that is to specify
   reserved numbers (similar to NAIF's reserved list for celestial objects (positive
   numbers) and spaceraft (negative numbers)). The difficulty here is that we'd need
   some "authority" to provide us with that list. This would be a lot of work.
1. **In conclusion**, we've decided to simply store objects as an array and embed
   a lookup table in the file. This table associates a unique hash mapping the object
   name to a position in the object list. The hashing function will be provided with
   the specs. The hashing function, chosen to be computationally simple and also
   not create too many collisions, will be published with the specs.
1. Finally, we also decided that the process of "building a reference frame" will
   require a user a provide _both_ the name of the center object and the name of
   the orientation (instead of relying on error-prone tokens). The function could
   be `my_anise_ctx.build_frame(ANISE_CONSTANT::Earth, ANISE_CONSTANT::J2000)`
   where the constants are both directly the hashes as integers.
1. When a user requests to add a new frame to the file, the mutuable function will
   trigger an error, unless using a specific function which will allow overwriting
   pre-existing frames.
